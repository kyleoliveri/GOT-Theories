# GOT-Theories

- GOT Theories is a fun application for Game of Thrones fans to share their theories and have discussions.

- When a user navigates to the site for the first time, they are prompted to create an account through Firebase Auth.

- This application was part of a group project in which I was responsible for the front-end development. The application was created using HTML, CSS, Materialize, Javascript, jQuery, Firebase, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars.js, and Moment.js
